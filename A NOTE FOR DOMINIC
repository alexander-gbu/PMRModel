Hi! I just wanted to give you some insight into the naming of the files and what each file does
The current model that i am using to compare to the experimental data is the ShellBalSSODE. That is where I use the adjusted equations. 
I am currently working on automating the PDE solver(PDEsolveryX) but at long times it does give the same result as the SS.
The FPDEsolver and FSSODE files were me trying to get the model in terms of flowrates but that failed because we needed the instantaneous volume.
