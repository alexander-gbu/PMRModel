Hi! I just wanted to give you some insight into the naming of the files and what each file does
The current model that i am using to compare to the experimental data is the ShellBalSSODE. That is where I use the adjusted equations. 
The current automated PDE solver is PDEsolver.m (The X solver is the old one)
The FPDEsolver and FSSODE files were me trying to get the model in terms of flowrates but that failed because we needed the instantaneous volume.
