PMR

it basically needs its final couple of tweaks and then we need to combine and compare. Make sure that all files are equal with constants and reaction rates
- combined out fixed temp should be made into its own file where we can print out everything but it is updated with the newest constants and stuff
- Need to check out the temp kink and why that happens. It is perplexing me
- have to adjust initial guess if we are getting rid of the temperature 


FeTTP

Look into the diffusion coefficients of FeTTP(III) to fit this better and then you would need to adjust the thickness. 
 - can fit the diffusion coefficients by using the god model joon baek

CO2R modeling:
 - improve the diffusion constants
 - adjust the reaction equation to include water and CO2 concentration
 - look at tylers data and see if it fits

k0 will become a fitting parameter
