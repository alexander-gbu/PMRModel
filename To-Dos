PMR



FeTTP

- do the reynolds number thing like in junbecks paper
- look into the global current calculation
    - look at the units and see if it all works out because it might be that we are doing current in units per area
    - the one based on diffusion, I am pretty sure that is not legal
        - investigate what happens when you set it to a set rate because techincally that is how a resistor conthingy works

Add the water without a reaction rate!

k0 will become a fitting parameter
