Just do ur own thing bro
- calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient and see how different it is across the thingy 

Check if the loss of energy balance is around the switch point (do overall both sides work out?)


Meeting w Dominic
- Calculation of enthalpy with enthalpy of formation fine
- Calculation of Yifei's numbers (U and Concentration) mine seem good
- How to line up the kinetics? that is fine

Print the reaction rates (can do this after the code is ran)

Compare to experiments to see if the code is actually accurate

Combine the two files and make itterative and then also combine all of the graphs too


make sure that reaction rate is calculated correctly. Adjust the flux area calculation
see if Cvh is more accurate (i think it might be with less points)

rxn rates is calculated twice, can just calculate them for the top row and not for the entire reactor
