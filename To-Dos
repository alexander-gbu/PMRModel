Run at different temps and then compare to experiments. See the code colab
Fix the temperature in comparison for ease of access
 - can also include the model temp in the label
Compare to experiments to see if the code is actually accurate

Can comapre the reaction rates (can do this after the code is ran)

make sure that reaction rate is calculated correctly. Adjust the flux area calculation
