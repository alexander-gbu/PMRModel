FeTTP: k0 will become a fitting parameter

- The CO2 steals the electrons from the FeTTP. So just subtract that from the currents and then the foot should be fixed.
- put in the equation so that you can just change the rotation rate and it fixes everything

CO2R modeling:
 - improve the diffusion constants
