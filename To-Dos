FeTTP

- do the reynolds number thing like in junbecks paper
    - Do it also with the FeTTP

- look into the global current calculation
    - units work out
    - the one based on diffusion, I am pretty sure that is not legal
        - investigate what happens when you set it to a set rate because techincally that is how a resistor conthingy works
    - cap the reaction rate for now and then we can do more theoretical work

Add the water without a reaction rate!
- There is no reaction with just the water 
    - the water in acetonitrile stays together
- Then we can also add the CO2 to CO reaction if I am really feeling it.
- so then how does the CO2 go to CO if the water does not react?


k0 will become a fitting parameter
