PMR



FeTTP: k0 will become a fitting parameter

- add a current for the creation of the FeCO2 compound. this would be without having the fe2 in the main thing

- Update Tylers diffusion coefficients file with the most recent updates
- investigate if HER could be happening
- play around with the constants so that the FeCO2 creation is limiting


- The CO2 steals the electrons from the FeTTP. So just subtract that from the currents and then the foot should be fixed.
- put in the equation so that you can just change the rotation rate and it fixes everything



CO2R modeling:
 - improve the diffusion constants
