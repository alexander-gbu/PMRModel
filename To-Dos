Recalculate enthalpy in vs out and see if then the heat that needs to be supplied is actually 3400 W/m2
- can use heat capacity to calculate the change
check for other overall heat transfer coefficient calculations
Compare to experiments to see if the code is actually accurate

Can comapre the reaction rates (can do this after the code is ran)

make sure that reaction rate is calculated correctly. Adjust the flux area calculation
