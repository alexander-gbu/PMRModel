PMR



FeTTP

Look into the diffusion coefficients of FeTTP(III) to fit this better and then you would need to adjust the thickness. 
 - can fit the diffusion coefficients by using the god model joon baek

CO2R modeling:
 - improve the diffusion constants
 - adjust the reaction equation to include water and CO2 concentration
 - look at tylers data and see if it fits

k0 will become a fitting parameter
