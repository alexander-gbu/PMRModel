There is something wrong with the equilibrium at the lower temperatures, I think it has to do with the temperature profile but I dont know

Adjust the model to fit better at lower temperatures

Can comapre the reaction rates (can do this after the code is ran)

make sure that reaction rate is calculated correctly. Adjust the flux area calculation
