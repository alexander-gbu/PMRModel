PMR



FeTTP

Look into the diffusion coefficients of FeTTP(III) to fit this better and then you would need to adjust the thickness. 
 - can fit the diffusion coefficients by using the god model joon baek

CO2R modeling:
 - improve the diffusion constants

 The CO2 steals the electrons from the FeTTP. So just subtract that from the currents and then the foot should be fixed.

k0 will become a fitting parameter
